# CSV Data Dictionary for \( m(r,c,o,a) \) Tables

This document describes the structure, meaning, and conventions of the CSV files containing exact enumeration data for the combinatorial function

\[
m(r,c,o,a).
\]

Each row of the dataset represents a single value of this function for a specific grid size and parameter combination.

---

## File Format

All data files are plain-text CSV (comma-separated values) with the following column order:

```text
r, c, o, a, count
```

Each row corresponds to one value of \( m(r,c,o,a) \).

---

## Column Definitions

### 1. `r` — Number of Rows

- Type: Integer  
- Range: r ≥ 1  
- Meaning: The number of rows in the grid.

### 2. `c` — Number of Columns

- Type: Integer  
- Range: c ≥ 1  
- Meaning: The number of columns in the grid.

Due to symmetry,

\[
m(r,c,o,a) = m(c,r,o,a),
\]

all datasets are generated with r ≤ c.

---

### 3. `o` — Occupied Cells

- Type: Integer  
- Range: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0%20%5Cle%20o%20%5Cle%20rc" />  
- Meaning: The number of occupied cells (selected vertices) in the grid.

Special cases:

- `o = 0` corresponds to the empty configuration.  
- `o = rc` corresponds to the fully occupied grid.

Boundary values:

\[
m(r,c,0,0) = 1, \qquad
m(r,c,rc,2rc-r-c) = 1.
\]

---

### 4. `a` — Adjacency Count

- Type: Integer  
- Range: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0%20%5Cle%20a%20%5Cle%202rc%20-%20r%20-%20c" />  
- Meaning: The number of horizontal/vertical adjacencies between occupied cells.

Each adjacency corresponds to an edge in the grid graph induced by the occupied cells.

---

### 5. `count` — Enumeration Value

- Type: Nonnegative integer (arbitrary precision)  
- Meaning: The exact value of

\[
m(r,c,o,a),
\]

i.e., the number of distinct subsets of \( o \) cells in an \( r \times c \) grid whose induced subgraph has exactly \( a \) edges.

All counts are exact (not approximate).

---

## Row Semantics

A row

```text
6, 9, 4, 2, 93079
```

means:

\[
m(6,9,4,2) = 93079.
\]

That is, there are 93,079 ways to place 4 occupied cells in a 6×9 grid such that exactly 2 adjacency edges occur.

---

## Completeness

For each fixed grid size \( (r,c) \), the dataset includes:

- All values of \( o \in \{0,1,\dots,rc\} \)  
- All values of \( a \) for which \( m(r,c,o,a) > 0 \)  

Values for which \( m(r,c,o,a) = 0 \) may be omitted.

---

## Data Integrity

- All values are generated by exact dynamic programming.
- No stochastic or approximate methods are used.
- Arithmetic is performed using arbitrary-precision integers.
- Results are deterministic and reproducible.

---

## Known Conventions

1. Grids are always stored with r ≤ c.  
2. Only nonzero counts are included.  
3. Files are named by grid size (e.g., `r6_c9.csv`).  
4. The column order is always `r, c, o, a, count`.  

---

## Intended Use

These CSV files are suitable for:

- Combinatorial analysis  
- Validation of theoretical formulas  
- Benchmarking approximation models  
- Reproducible computational research  

---

## Summary

Each CSV row records an exact value of the function \( m(r,c,o,a) \), fully specifying:

- The grid size  
- The number of occupied cells  
- The number of adjacencies  
- The exact enumeration count  

This data dictionary ensures consistent interpretation and reuse of the dataset.
